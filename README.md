# SSOI: Andamio Self Sovereign On-chain Identity

## Introduction

Andamio SSOI (Self-Sovereign On-chain Identity) is a decentralized identity framework built on the Cardano blockchain. It provides a robust solution for creating and managing decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials. By leveraging blockchain's immutability and transparency, Andamio SSOI enables trustless identity management for individuals, organizations, and applications.

Andamio SSOI generalizes and enhances the functionality of the Andamio Access Token, making it an open and inclusive solution for a broader range of use cases. This implementation allows seamless integration with decentralized applications (dApps) and supports advanced identity paradigms like Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

## Features

- **Blockchain Integration**: Utilizes the Cardano blockchain for secure, verifiable, and on-chain identity management.
- **Interoperable**: Designed to integrate with existing projects like Atala PRISM and other Cardano-based identity systems.
- **Extensible**: Modular architecture enables customization and new experiments in identity systems.
- **RBAC Support**: Incorporates Role-Based Access Control to define permissions and roles on-chain.
